# Data Visualization Project in R

## 📚 Overview

This repository contains R code for various data visualization projects, created as part of my studies at the **University of Miguel Hernandez of Elche**. As such, part of the code is written in Spanish. The project is structured to provide both the RMarkdown source files and the final visual outputs in PDF format for better readability on GitHub.

## 🛠 Files and Directories

- **code/**: Contains all the RMarkdown (`.Rmd`) files where the data visualization code is developed.
- **outputs/**: Holds the resulting visualizations and reports in PDF format, making them easier to view directly on GitHub.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository URL]
   ```

2. Navigate to the **code/** directory to explore the RMarkdown files for different data visualizations.
   ```bash
   cd code/
   ```

3. For better readability, the output PDFs can be directly accessed from the **outputs/** folder:
   ```bash
   cd outputs/
   ```

## 📂 Project Structure

```
├── code/                  # Contains all RMarkdown files for data visualization
├── outputs/               # PDF versions of the visualizations and reports
└── README.md              # Project description
```

## 📝 Future Enhancements
- Include additional datasets to demonstrate more complex visualization techniques.
